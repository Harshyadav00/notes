# Notes Application

This is a secure, web-based notes application built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API Design:** RESTful
- **Security:** Spring Security (Optional)

**Features:**

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) notes.
- User authentication and authorization (if Spring Security is implemented).
- Secure storage of note content in a MySQL database.
- Well-structured and maintainable codebase.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
   - A MySQL database server running.
   - Basic understanding of React, Spring Boot, MySQL, REST APIs, and Spring Security (optional).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

        git clone https://github.com/Harshyadav00/notes.git

3. **Setup Backend:**

        cd notes-application/backend
        mvn clean install

5. **Configure database connection details in application.properties**

        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/notes_db
        spring.datasource.username=your_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_password

6. **Start the Backend:**

       mvn spring-boot:run

7. **Set up the Frontend (React):**

   - **navigate to frontend repository**

         cd notes/client
     
   - **install dependencies**

         npm install
   - **run the enviorment**

         npm start

**Usage:**

  1.  Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your React development server configuration).
  2.  If Spring Security is implemented, you'll need to authenticate using valid credentials.
  3. You can then start creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes through the user interface.
